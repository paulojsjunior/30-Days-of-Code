Objective
Today we will expand our knowledge of strings, combining it with what we have already learned about loops.

Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N - 1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example
s = adbecf
Print abc def

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a string, S.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
2 <= length of S <= 10000

Output Format
For each String Sj (where 0 <= j <= T - 1), print Sj's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by Sj's odd-indexed characters.
